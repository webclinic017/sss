# SSS Overview
 Stock Scanner & Screener: A `yfinance`-based Stock Scanner & Screener for the Israeli and US Stock Markets (Extendable to other stock markets as well). Within the code, the following libraries and fonts are used:
 - https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/
 - https://pypi.org/project/fpdf/
 - https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
 - https://pypi.org/project/forex-python/
 - https://pypi.org/project/CurrencyConverter/
 - https://pypi.org/project/py-currency-converter/
 - https://pypi.org/project/PyCurrency-Converter/
 - https://pypi.org/project/currency.converter/
 - https://fonts2u.com/dejavu-sans-condensed.font

The stocks scan and sorting is done according to the below documentation (Core Equation and Multi-Dimensional scan) written using Google Documents (https://www.google.com/docs/about/):

# Setup
- Install `Python 3.8` or higher from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install `Pycharm Community Edition` from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
- Download the `SSS` source code as a Zip file from this page (https://github.com/asafravid/sss/archive/master.zip) or clone/fork the repository directly
- Open Project from folder (to which you unzipped the `sss` source code)
- No further steps required apart from `pip[3]` installing relevant libraries:
  - `cd <[path to]Python 3.8>`
  - `pip[3] install pandas`
  - `pip[3] install yfinance`
  - `pip[3] install fpdf`
  - `pip[3] install forex_python` and/or `pip[3] install forex-ython`
  - `pip[3] install numpy`
  - `pip[3] install CurrencyConverter`
  - `pip[3] install PyCurrency-Converter`
  - `pip[3] install currency.converter`
- Note that for `yfinance` - I may be providing updated sources since they take time to update by the developers, so `pip3 install yfinance` from the origin, and then update (using comparison SW) the necessary changes I made (not too many) to run the `SSS` most efficiently and informatively.
  
# Run Step-By-Step Instructions
- 1: Set the required scanning mode (`custom`/`tase`/`nsr`/`all`) in `sss_run.py` and run `sss_run.py`
- 2: A Results folder shall be created under `Results` Folder
- 3: Feed the Results path into the `research_mode` (Multi-Dimensional Scan). A `PDF` and `sss_results.csv` files shall be created in the same folder

# Indices Maintenance
- Download `TASE` latest components via https://info.tase.co.il/eng/MarketData/Stocks/MarketData/Pages/MarketData.aspx into `Indices/Data_TASE.csv` -> This operation is done automatically upon each scan (with `research_mode = False`) via `sss_indices.py`
- Download `NASDAQ100` latest components via https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/nasdaq-ndx-index into `Indices/nasdaq100-components.csv`
- Download `Russel1000` latest components via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_1000_Index into `russell-1000-index.csv` 
- Download `S&P500` latest components into `Indices/snp500-components.csv`  (Remove last line indicating creation date)
- Download `NASDAQ` latest components via `ftp://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/symboldirectory/` into `Indices/nasdaqlisted.csv` (Convert `.txt` to `.csv` and remove last line indicating creation date) using an FTP Client (such as https://filezilla-project.org/)
- Download `NASDAQ` Other Listed components via `ftp://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/symboldirectory/` into `Indices/otherlisted.csv` (Convert `.txt` to `.csv` and remove last line indicating creation date) using an FTP Client (such as https://filezilla-project.org/)
- Download `NASDAQ` Traded components via `ftp://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/symboldirectory/` into `Indices/nasdaqtraded.csv` (Convert `.txt` to `.csv` and remove last line indicating creation date) using an FTP Client (such as https://filezilla-project.org/)
- You can also create your own indice/group of stocks by either overriding the above files' contents or simply adding your own indice to the code support. Use Custom Mode, and example in `sss_run.py`
- Checkout http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=symboldirdefs for all symbol definitions (for instance - `$` in stock names, 5-letter stocks ending with `Y`)

# Disclaimer
- The Scan Results are __By No Neans__ to be interpreted as reccomendations.
- The Results are merely a basis for Research and Analysis.

# Understanding and Verifying Units of yfinance parameters
- Units can compared to https://www.macroaxis.com/stock-analysis/CMRE/Costamare (i.e. CMRE can be replaced for any stock ticker/symbol)
- Use case: `CMRE`'s `yfinance` `earningsQuarterlyGrowth` is `-0.298`, and website shows `-29.80%` so the match yields that `yfinance` reports in direct ratio (not `%`)

# Looking Forward for Contributions
- Good luck and you are welcome to contribute to this project:
  - Add other contries' stock markets
  - Past reccomendations and present results - for proving that the model works (a prototype is ready `sss_results_performance.py`)
  - Multi-Dimensional Scan enhancements (scan over `EQG`s, etc)
